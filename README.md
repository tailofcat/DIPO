## Feature extractors

We use the same backbone network and training strategies as 'S2M2_R'. Please refer to the [link](https://github.com/nupurkmr9/S2M2_fewshot) for the backbone training.  



Or you can download features/pretrained models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IjqOYLRH0OwkMZo8Tp4EG02ltDppi61n) and unzip it. After downloading the extracted features, please adjust your file path according to the code.



## Evaluate

To evaluate the proposed method, run:

```
python evaluate_DIPO.py
